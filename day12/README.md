Recursive algorithm was written by ChatGPT, I fixed it a little by examining output (I was lucky to find some edge cases at abot 980th line =) )

At part 2 I realized that I need to reuse results of part1 and generate input for part 2, but I was not sure that part 1 is optimal enough and fits
that approach.

Then I went to leaderboard, was lucky second time to find proper solution from the first try, then I gave up. I am sorry(

Day12 was hard and insightful though.

I dont know if I will solve next days at all, or use golang for that, at least.

Maybe it is more useful to return at 2015 AOC and try python.

Or developing the game for fun is all I need for now.

Don't forget to have fun, guys. It really matters.




P.S. How about using channels and goroutines? The natural way of proceeding in mastering golang is the skill of parallelizing algos. IMHO
